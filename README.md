The code to run the reference scenario is Projection - Reference.sas. Projection-Convergence.sas is for the higher labor force participation scenario.
The SAS7BDAT files contain the assumptions for education (edu), emigration (emig), the fertility schedule (fert_sched), immigration (immig), the skill-adjustment factor (saf), the sex ratio at birth (srb), and the survival ratio (sx).
LFP_Rate.csv and LFP_Rate-Convergence.csv contain the parameters for labor force participation rates in the reference and higher labor force participation scenarios, respectively.
Download all the files. Change the folder name accordingly in Projection - Reference.sas and Projection - Convergence.sas. Run the code.
Since output files overwrite each other, it is better to run scenarios in separate folders (duplicate the parameter files).
